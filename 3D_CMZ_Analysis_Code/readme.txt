Here we share all of the code used to make the figures for the 3-D CMZ Paper series as well as much of the analysis code. These are not heavily commented or intended to be completely generalized for other data / situations. They are here for transparency of methodology and for adaptation if you find any aspect of it useful. If you find it useful, please cite the relevant papers in any work that utilizes this code or the data products produced in the paper series.

You may reach out to the authors with questions.
