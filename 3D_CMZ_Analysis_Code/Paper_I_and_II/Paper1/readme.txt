Paper 1 readme

This directory contains files used to make the figures for 3-D CMZ Paper 1 as well as much of the analysis code. These are not heavily commented or intended to be completely generalized for other data / situations. They are here for transparency of methodology and for adaptation if you find any aspect of it useful. If you find it useful, please cite the paper in any work that utilizes this code or the data products produced in the paper.

The figure files are labelled according to which figure in the text they correspond. In some cases, the figures were then arranged together in a graphical interface to appear as they do in the manuscript. However, these files should contain the complete code for the underlying figures.

The code to do the modified blackbody fits was created, tested, and run many years ago (in a galaxy far far away) (not really, just kidding about that part, but was a long time ago!) in IDL. The final products were good and reliable. We did not convert these to python, but we share the code here in case it is useful for you.
